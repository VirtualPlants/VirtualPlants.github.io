Mars-alt
========

**Mars Alt is a pipeline primary designed to track cell lineages at different time steps.**
**It provides algorithms for three-dimensional reconstruction and cell segmentationâ€“automated lineage tracking (MARS-ALT).**
**Mars-Alt algorithms allow multiple angles 3d images fusion and segmentation in order to accurately identify and track cell lineages through multiple rounds of cell division during development.**
