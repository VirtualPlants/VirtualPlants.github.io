Use **gitk**, it is a good help, when beginning, to visualize what happens.

If you are a new git user, you can try git on `try.github.io <http://try.github.io>`_ to be more familiar with git commands. 

You can also have a look to `Atlassian Git documentation <https://fr.atlassian.com/git>`_.

Something is wrong, see `undo in git <http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html>`_ page.
