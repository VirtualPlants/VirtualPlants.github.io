The Zen of Git by Guillaume BÃ¢ty

  - **Work on your own personal repository** you can break everything, it doesn't matter.
  - **Never never never use push --force**: you can destroy work (and be hated) for ever!
  - **Not confident** with a command ?, **create a branch before**! You will be able to come back.
  - **Push your branches** in a **distant personal repository**.
  - **Never panic** If you have followed previous rules, there is a solution
  - **Read git messages**, yes it is useful and generally answer to your questions
  - **Lost in the branches ?** show log and branches (gitk --all or git log --graph && git branch)
  - **Lost in your modifications ?** git status
  - **Lost in repositories ?** git remote -v
  - **A "--abort" option maybe exists**, git merge --abort, git rebase --abort, ...
