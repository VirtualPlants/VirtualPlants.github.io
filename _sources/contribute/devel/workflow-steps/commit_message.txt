Commit message
==============

Please write a `good commit message <http://web-design-weekly.com/blog/2013/09/01/a-better-git-commit/>`_:

Try to limit using the -m commit flag.

If using the simpler git commit command it should open up Vim (if it’s your default editor) where you can construct a better commit by following some of these simple steps.

      * The **first line should be a short summary**. Referencing the bug number or the main accomplishment of the change. e.g “Fixes issue #8976″. This is the title of your commit and should be **less than 50 characters**.
      * Then a **line break**.
      * Followed by a **longer detailed description about the things that changed**. This section is a really good place to explain what and why. You could cover statistics, performance wins, roadblocks, etc. The text should be wrapped at 72 characters.
